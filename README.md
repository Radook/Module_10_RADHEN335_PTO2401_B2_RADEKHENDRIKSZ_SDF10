## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

-Software systems that already exist can be integrated with new applications using APIs. As a result, development can go more quickly because no feature needs to be created from start. APIs allow you to take advantage of pre-written code.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

-The user interface serves as the user's area to interact, while the backend appl api allows communication between the user and the underlying system or application.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

-The API request, the server, and the API response are the three main parts of an API. Information from the client is included in the request, which is processed by the server, and the result or data supplied by the server is included in the response.

-Web APIs: Web APIs are APIs that are accessed over the internet using HTTP. They enable communication and interaction between different software systems or applications over the web. 

-RESTful APIs are a style of web architecture emphasizing simple communication over HTTP using standard operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. They enable interoperability between computer systems on the internet by allowing clients to access and manipulate resources stored on servers in a stateless manner.

-I find web APIS the most useful as you can grab any service that uses apis, such as spotify and netlix, and implement it in any app or page you want to develop, and for free most the time.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

-I have used postman for previous courses i've used, but never touched on any other ones. I could barely understand how postman worked when i first tried it, but now i know it is used to build and use APIS. restfox is a new one that has been brought up in the video and it seems easy enough to understand
how it works

-Twilio was the most recent one i had to learn as it was part of the video, not all the same options were there from the video as i assume they constantly update, remove and or move content around so i couldn't follow exactly the same was as the guy in
the video did, but i got the general concept on how it works and interacts frim your code and terminal, all the way back to twillio

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

-I understand the concept of how twilio works, and a little bit of how vue works but not too much. I just need to watch more vids and project videos on how people use both apis and vue, and maybe not only twilio but other services too.
